# 🎯 JobHirence – Online Job Portal System

**JobHirence** is a modern, feature-rich recruitment platform built using **PHP (Laravel Framework)** and **MySQL**. It streamlines the entire hiring process by providing tools for job seekers, recruiters, and administrators—all in one secure web application.

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

**JobHirence** is a user-friendly online job portal developed after analyzing multiple job sites to address common recruitment challenges. The goal is to make hiring more **efficient**, **flexible**, and **accessible** for both job seekers and employers.

A standout feature is the **dual-role functionality**, allowing users to apply for jobs as candidates and also act as employers to post and manage their own listings. This empowers users to hire, manage applications, and grow their network—all from a single account.

Built with Laravel (PHP) and MySQL, JobHirence includes real-time tracking, social login, password recovery, and role-based panels for users, companies, and admins—reducing manual work and streamlining workflows.
